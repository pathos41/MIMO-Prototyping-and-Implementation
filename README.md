Capacity Distribution of MIMO and SISO

Capacity Distribution of Theoretical MIMO Channels at 10dB SNR

UHR: Uncorrelated high-rank model

ULR: Uncorrelated low-rank model

CLR: Correlated low-rank model

Capacity Distribution of Theoretical SISO Channels at 10dB SNR

LR: low rank. 1*1 LR, defined by the ULR model with M=N=1.

HR: high rank. 1*1 HR, defined by the UHR model with M=N=1.
